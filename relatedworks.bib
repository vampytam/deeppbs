abstract = {Abstract Protein–DNA binding is a fundamental component of gene regulatory processes, but it is still not completely understood how proteins recognize their target sites in the genome. Besides hydrogen bonding in the major groove (base readout), proteins recognize minor-groove geometry using positively charged amino acids (shape readout). The underlying mechanism of DNA shape readout involves the correlation between minor-groove width and electrostatic potential (EP). To probe this biophysical effect directly, rather than using minor-groove width as an indirect measure for shape readout, we developed a methodology, DNAphi, for predicting EP in the minor groove and confirmed the direct role of EP in protein–DNA binding using massive sequencing data. The DNAphi method uses a sliding-window approach to mine results from non-linear Poisson–Boltzmann (NLPB) calculations on DNA structures derived from all-atom Monte Carlo simulations. We validated this approach, which only requires nucleotide sequence as input, based on direct comparison with NLPB calculations for available crystal structures. Using statistical machine-learning approaches, we showed that adding EP as a biophysical feature can improve the predictive power of quantitative binding specificity models across 27 transcription factor families. High-throughput prediction of EP offers a novel way to integrate biophysical and genomic studies of protein–DNA binding.},

abstract = {Abstract Uncovering the mechanisms that affect the binding specificity of transcription factors (TFs) is critical for understanding the principles of gene regulation. Although sequence-based models have been used successfully to predict TF binding specificities, we found that including DNA shape information in these models improved their accuracy and interpretability. Previously, we developed a method for modeling DNA binding specificities based on DNA shape features extracted from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. Prediction accuracies of our models, however, have not yet been compared to accuracies of models incorporating DNA shape information extracted from X-ray crystallography (XRC) data or Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. Here, we integrated DNA shape information extracted from MC or MD simulations and XRC data into predictive models of TF binding and compared their performance. Models that incorporated structural information consistently showed improved performance over sequence-based models regardless of data source. Furthermore, we derived and validated nine additional DNA shape features beyond our original set of four features. The expanded repertoire of 13 distinct DNA shape features, including six intra-base pair and six inter-base pair parameters and minor groove width, is available in our R/Bioconductor package DNAshapeR and enables a comprehensive structural description of the double helix on a genome-wide scale.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) achieve DNA‐binding specificity through contacts with functional groups of bases (base readout) and readout of structural properties of the double helix (shape readout). Currently, it remains unclear whether DNA shape readout is utilized by only a few selected TF families, or whether this mechanism is used extensively by most TF families. We resequenced data from previously published HT‐SELEX experiments, the most extensive mammalian TF–DNA binding data available to date. Using these data, we demonstrated the contributions of DNA shape readout across diverse TF families and its importance in core motif‐flanking regions. Statistical machine‐learning models combined with feature‐selection techniques helped to reveal the nucleotide position‐dependent DNA shape readout in TF‐binding sites and the TF family‐specific position dependence. Based on these results, we proposed novel DNA shape logos to visualize the DNA shape preferences of TFs. Overall, this work suggests a way of obtaining mechanistic insights into TF–DNA binding without relying on experimentally solved all‐atom structures.},

Long-term monitoring and lowering of serum uric acid levels may be crucial for diagnosis and effective management of these conditions. However, current strategies are not sufficient for accurate diagnosis and successful long-term management of hyperuricemia. Moreover, drug-based therapeutics can cause side effects in patients. The intestinal tract plays an important role in maintaining healthy serum acid levels. Hence, we investigated the engineered human commensal Escherichia coli as a novel method for diagnosis and long-term management of hyperuricemia. To monitor changes in uric acid concentration in the intestinal lumen, we developed a bioreporter using the uric acid responsive synthetic promoter, pucpro, and uric acid binding Bacillus subtilis PucR protein. Results demonstrated that the bioreporter module in commensal E. coli can detect changes in uric acid concentration in a dose-dependent manner. To eliminate the excess uric acid, we designed a uric acid degradation module, which overexpresses an E. coli uric acid transporter and a B. subtilis urate oxidase. Strains engineered with this module degraded all the uric acid (250 µM) found in the environment within 24 h, which is significantly lower (p < 0.001) compared to wild type E. coli. Finally, we designed an in vitro model using human intestinal cell line, Caco-2, which provided a versatile tool to study the uric acid transport and degradation in an environment mimicking the human intestinal tract. Results showed that engineered commensal E. coli reduced (p < 0.01) the apical uric acid concentration by 40.35% compared to wild type E. coli. This study shows that reprogramming E. coli holds promise as a valid alternative synthetic biology therapy to monitor and maintain healthy serum uric acid levels.},

abstract = {Transcription factors (TFs) interpret DNA sequence by probing the chemical and structural properties of the nucleotide polymer. DNA shape is thought to enable a parsimonious representation of dependencies between nucleotide positions. Here, we propose a unified mathematical representation of the DNA sequence dependence of shape and TF binding, respectively, which simplifies and enhances analysis of shape readout. First, we demonstrate that linear models based on mononucleotide features alone account for 60–70% of the variance in minor groove width, roll, helix twist, and propeller twist. This explains why simple scoring matrices that ignore all dependencies between nucleotide positions can partially account for DNA shape readout by a TF. Adding dinucleotide features as sequence‐to‐shape predictors to our model, we can almost perfectly explain the shape parameters. Building on this observation, we developed a post hoc analysis method that can be used to analyze any mechanism‐agnostic protein–DNA binding model in terms of shape readout. Our insights provide an alternative strategy for using DNA shape information to enhance our understanding of how cis‐regulatory codes are interpreted by the cellular machinery.},

abstract = {Abstract Myocyte enhancer factor-2B (MEF2B) has the unique capability of binding to its DNA target sites with a degenerate motif, while still functioning as a gene-specific transcriptional regulator. Identifying its DNA targets is crucial given regulatory roles exerted by members of the MEF2 family and MEF2B’s involvement in B-cell lymphoma. Analyzing structural data and SELEX-seq experimental results, we deduced the DNA sequence and shape determinants of MEF2B target sites on a high-throughput basis in vitro for wild-type and mutant proteins. Quantitative modeling of MEF2B binding affinities and computational simulations exposed the DNA readout mechanisms of MEF2B. The resulting binding signature of MEF2B revealed distinct intricacies of DNA recognition compared to other transcription factors. MEF2B uses base readout at its half-sites combined with shape readout at the center of its degenerate motif, where A-tract polarity dictates nuances of binding. The predominant role of shape readout at the center of the core motif, with most contacts formed in the minor groove, differs from previously observed protein–DNA readout modes. MEF2B, therefore, represents a unique protein for studies of the role of DNA shape in achieving binding specificity. MEF2B–DNA recognition mechanisms are likely representative for other members of the MEF2 family.},

However, the atomic composition of a nucleotide pair can be altered by chemical modifications, different base-pairing geometries, or mismatches. As only a few atoms contribute to binding specificity, we propose that compared to a sequence model, a chemistry-based model that directly encodes protein–DNA contacts may more robustly capture the chemical variations of DNA.

abstract = {Abstract Mechanisms of protein-DNA interactions are involved in a wide range of biological activities and processes. Accurately identifying binding sites between proteins and DNA is crucial for analyzing genetic material, exploring protein functions, and designing novel drugs. In recent years, several computational methods have been proposed as alternatives to time-consuming and expensive traditional experiments. However, accurately predicting protein-DNA binding sites still remains a challenge. Existing computational methods often rely on handcrafted features and a single-model architecture, leaving room for improvement. We propose a novel computational method, called EGPDI, based on multi-view graph embedding fusion. This approach involves the integration of Equivariant Graph Neural Networks (EGNN) and Graph Convolutional Networks II (GCNII), independently configured to profoundly mine the global and local node embedding representations. An advanced gated multi-head attention mechanism is subsequently employed to capture the attention weights of the dual embedding representations, thereby facilitating the integration of node features. Besides, extra node features from protein language models are introduced to provide more structural information. To our knowledge, this is the first time that multi-view graph embedding fusion has been applied to the task of protein–DNA binding site prediction. The results of five-fold cross-validation and independent testing demonstrate that EGPDI outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Further comparative experiments and case studies also verify the superiority and generalization ability of EGPDI.},

Whereas these sequence motifs are quite accurate descriptions of DNA binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs), proteins recognize DNA as a three-dimensional object. DNA structural features refine the description of TF binding specificities and provide mechanistic insights into protein–DNA recognition. Existing motif databases contain extensive nucleotide sequences identified in binding experiments based on their selection by a TF. To utilize DNA shape information when analysing the DNA binding specificities of TFs, we developed a new tool, the TFBSshape database (available at http://rohslab.cmb.usc.edu/TFBSshape/), for calculating DNA structural features from nucleotide sequences provided by motif databases. The TFBSshape database can be used to generate heat maps and quantitative data for DNA structural features (i.e., minor groove width, roll, propeller twist and helix twist) for 739 TF datasets from 23 different species derived from the motif databases JASPAR and UniPROBE. As demonstrated for the basic helix-loop-helix and homeodomain TF families, our TFBSshape database can be used to compare, qualitatively and quantitatively, the DNA binding specificities of closely related TFs and, thus, uncover differential DNA binding specificities that are not apparent from nucleotide sequence alone.},

abstract = {Accurate identification of protein nucleic acid binding residues poses a significant challenge with important implications for various biological processes and drug design. Many typical computational methods for protein analysis rely on a single model that could ignore either the semantic context of the protein or the global 3D geometric information. Consequently, these approaches may result in incomplete or inaccurate protein analysis. To address the above issue, in this paper, we present CrossBind, a novel collaborative cross modal approach for identifying binding residues by exploiting both protein geometric structure and its sequence prior knowledge extracted from a large scale protein language model. Specifically, our multi modal approach leverages a contrastive learning technique and atom wise attention to capture the positional relationships between atoms and residues, thereby incorporating fine grained local geometric knowledge, for better binding residue prediction. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the next best state of the art methods, GraphSite and GraphBind, on DNA and RNA datasets by 10.8/17.3% in terms of the harmonic mean of precision and recall (F1 Score) and 11.9/24.8% in Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC), respectively.

The existing tools employ TF-DNA binding profiles from in vitro high-throughput technologies to predict TF-DNA binding affinity. However, TFs tend to bind to sequences in open chromatin regions in vivo, such TF binding preference is seldomly considered by these existing tools. In this study, we developed TRAFICA, an open chromatin language model to predict TF-DNA binding affinity by integrating the characteristics of sequences from open chromatin regions in ATAC-seq experiments and in vitro TF-DNA binding profiles from high-throughput technologies. We applied self-supervised learning to pre-train TRAFICA on over 13 million nucleotide sequences from the peaks in ATAC-seq experiments to learn the TF binding preference in vivo. TRAFICA was further fine-tuned using the TF-DNA binding profiles from PBM and HT-SELEX technologies to learn the association between TFs and their target DNA sequences. We observed that TRAFICA significantly outperformed both machine learning-based and deep learning-based tools in predicting in vitro and in vivo TF-DNA binding affinity. These findings indicate that considering the characteristics of sequences from open chromatin regions could significantly improve TF-DNA binding affinity prediction, particularly when limited TF-DNA binding profiles from high-throughput technologies are available for specific TFs.},

abstract = {Motivation Transcription factors (TFs) bind to specific DNA sequence motifs. Several lines of evidence suggest that TF-DNA binding is mediated in part by properties of the local DNA shape: the width of the minor groove, the relative orientations of adjacent base pairs, etc. Several methods have been developed to jointly account for DNA sequence and shape properties in predicting TF binding affinity. However, a limitation of these methods is that they typically require a training set of aligned TF binding sites. Results We describe a sequence+shape kernel that leverages DNA sequence and shape information to better understand protein-DNA binding preference and affinity. This kernel extends an existing class of k-mer based sequence kernels, based on the recently described di-mismatch kernel. Using three in vitro benchmark datasets, derived from universal protein binding microarrays (uPBMs), genomic context PBMs (gcPBMs) and SELEX-seq data, we demonstrate that incorporating DNA shape information improves our ability to predict protein-DNA binding affinity. In particular, we observe that (1) the k-spectrum+shape model performs better than the classical k-spectrum kernel, particularly for small k values; (2) the di-mismatch kernel performs better than the k-mer kernel, for larger k; and (3) the di-mismatch+shape kernel performs better than the di-mismatch kernel for intermediate k values.

abstract = {Significance Genomes provide an abundance of putative binding sites for each transcription factor (TF). However, only small subsets of these potential targets are functional. TFs of the same protein family bind to target sites that are very similar but not identical. This distinction allows closely related TFs to regulate different genes and thus execute distinct functions. Because the nucleotide sequence of the core motif is often not sufficient for identifying a genomic target, we refined the description of TF binding sites by introducing a combination of DNA sequence and shape features, which consistently improved the modeling of in vitro TF−DNA binding specificities. Although additional factors affect TF binding in vivo, shape-augmented models reveal binding specificity mechanisms that are not apparent from sequence alone. DNA binding specificities of transcription factors (TFs) are a key component of gene regulatory processes. Underlying mechanisms that explain the highly specific binding of TFs to their genomic target sites are poorly understood. A better understanding of TF−DNA binding requires the ability to quantitatively model TF binding to accessible DNA as its basic step, before additional in vivo components can be considered. Traditionally, these models were built based on nucleotide sequence. Here, we integrated 3D DNA shape information derived with a high-throughput approach into the modeling of TF binding specificities. Using support vector regression, we trained quantitative models of TF binding specificity based on protein binding microarray (PBM) data for 68 mammalian TFs. The evaluation of our models included cross-validation on specific PBM array designs, testing across different PBM array designs, and using PBM-trained models to predict relative binding affinities derived from in vitro selection combined with deep sequencing (SELEX-seq). Our results showed that shape-augmented models compared favorably to sequence-based models. Although both k-mer and DNA shape features can encode interdependencies between nucleotide positions of the binding site, using DNA shape features reduced the dimensionality of the feature space. In addition, analyzing the feature weights of DNA shape-augmented models uncovered TF family-specific structural readout mechanisms that were not revealed by the DNA sequence. As such, this work combines knowledge from structural biology and genomics, and suggests a new path toward understanding TF binding and genome function.},

abstract = {Knowledge of how proteins interact with DNA is essential for understanding gene regulation. While DNA-binding specificities for thousands of transcription factors (TFs) have been determined, the specific amino acid-base interactions comprising their structural interfaces are largely unknown. This lack of resolution hampers attempts to leverage these data in order to predict specificities for uncharacterized TFs or TFs mutated in disease. Here we introduce rCLAMPS (Recognition Code Learning via Automated Mapping of Protein-DNA Structural interfaces), a probabilistic approach that uses DNA-binding specificities for TFs from the same structural family to simultaneously infer both which nucleotide positions are contacted by particular amino acids within the TF as well as a recognition code that relates each base-contacting amino acid to nucleotide preferences at the DNA positions it contacts. We apply rCLAMPS to homeodomains, the second largest family of TFs in metazoans, and demonstrate that it learns a highly effective recognition code that can predict de novo DNA-binding specificities for TFs. Furthermore, we show that the inferred amino acid-nucleotide contacts reveal whether and how nucleotide preferences at individual binding site positions are altered by mutations within TFs. Our approach is an important step towards automatically uncovering the determinants of protein-DNA specificity from large compendia of DNA-binding specificities, and inferring the altered functionalities of TFs mutated in disease.},

The main rationale for this database is to be able to derive mechanistic insights in protein–DNA readout modes from sequencing data without available structures. We extended the quantity and dimensionality of TFBSshape, from mostly in vitro to in vivo binding and from unmethylated to methylated DNA. This new release of TFBSshape improves its functionality and launches a responsive and user-friendly web interface for easy access to the data. The current expansion includes new entries from the most recent collections of transcription factors (TFs) from the JASPAR and UniPROBE databases, methylated TFBSs derived from in vitro high-throughput EpiSELEX-seq binding assays and in vivo methylated TFBSs from the MeDReaders database. TFBSshape content has increased to 2428 structural profiles for 1900 TFs from 39 different species. The structural profiles for each TFBS entry now include 13 shape features and minor groove electrostatic potential for standard DNA and four shape features for methylated DNA. We improved the flexibility and accuracy for the shape-based alignment of TFBSs and designed new tools to compare methylated and unmethylated structural profiles of TFs and methods to derive DNA shape-preserving nucleotide mutations in TFBSs.},

Accurate quantitative definition of their intrinsic DNA binding preferences is critical to understanding their biological function. High-throughput in vitro technology has recently been used to deeply probe the DNA binding specificity of hundreds of eukaryotic transcription factors, yet algorithms for analyzing such data have not yet fully matured. Here, we present a general framework (FeatureREDUCE) for building sequence-to-affinity models based on a biophysically interpretable and extensible model of protein-DNA interaction that can account for dependencies between nucleotides within the binding interface or multiple modes of binding. When training on protein binding microarray (PBM) data, we use robust regression and modeling of technology-specific biases to infer specificity models of unprecedented accuracy and precision.

abstract = {Understanding the principles of DNA binding by transcription factors (TFs) is of primary importance for studying gene regulation. Recently, several lines of evidence suggested that both DNA sequence and shape contribute to TF binding. However, the question if in the absence of any sequence similarity to the binding motif, DNA shape can still increase probability of binding was yet to be addressed. To address this challenge, we developed Co-SELECT, a computational approach to analyze the results of in vitro HT-SELEX experiments for TF-DNA binding. Specifically, the presence of motif-free sequences in late HT-SELEX rounds and their enrichment in weak binders allowed us to detect evidence for the role of DNA shape features in TF binding. Our approach revealed that, even in the absence of the sequence motif, TFs have propensity to weakly bind to DNA molecules enriched in specific shape features. Surprisingly, we also found that some properties of DNA shape contribute to promiscuous binding of all tested TF families. Strikingly, such promiscuously bound shapes correspond to the most frequent shape formed by the DNA. We propose that this promiscuous binding facilitates diffusing of TFs along the DNA molecule before it is locked in its binding site.},

abstract = {SEPALLATA3 of Arabidopsis thaliana is a MADS-domain transcription factor and a central player in flower development. MADS-domain proteins bind as dimers to AT-rich sequences termed ‘CArG-boxes’ which share the consensus 5’-CC(A/T)6GG-3’. Since only a fraction of the abundant CArG-boxes in the Arabidopsis genome are bound by SEPALLATA3, more elaborate principles have to be discovered to better understand which features turn CArG-box sequences into genuine recognition sites. Here, we investigated to which extent the shape of the DNA contributes to the DNA-binding specificity of SEPALLATA3. We determined in vitro binding affinities of SEPALLATA3 to a variety of DNA probes which all contain the CArG-box motif, but differ in their DNA shape characteristics. We found that binding affinity correlates well with certain DNA shape features associated with ‘A-tracts’. Analysis of SEPALLATA3 proteins with single amino acid substitutions in the DNA-binding MADS-domain further revealed that a highly conserved arginine residue, which is expected to contact the DNA minor groove, contributes significantly to the shape readout. Our studies show that the specific recognition of cis-regulatory elements by plant MADS-domain transcription factors heavily depend on shape readout mechanisms and that the absence of a critical arginine residue in the MADS-domain impairs binding specificity.},

abstract = {Abstract Noncoding DNA sequences, which play various roles in gene expression and regulation, are under evolutionary pressure. Gene regulation requires specific protein–DNA binding events, and our previous studies showed that both DNA sequence and shape readout are employed by transcription factors (TFs) to achieve DNA binding specificity. By investigating the shape-disrupting properties of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in human regulatory regions, we established a link between disruptive local DNA shape changes and loss of specific TF binding. Furthermore, we described cases where disease-associated SNPs may alter TF binding through DNA shape changes. This link led us to hypothesize that local DNA shape within and around TF binding sites is under selection pressure. To verify this hypothesis, we analyzed SNP data derived from 216 natural strains of Drosophila melanogaster. Comparing SNPs located in functional and nonfunctional regions within experimentally validated cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) from D. melanogaster that are active in the blastoderm stage of development, we found that SNPs within functional regions tended to cause smaller DNA shape variations. Furthermore, SNPs with higher minor allele frequency were more likely to result in smaller DNA shape variations. The same analysis based on a large number of SNPs in putative CRMs of the D. melanogaster genome derived from DNase I accessibility data confirmed these observations. Taken together, our results indicate that common SNPs in functional regions tend to maintain DNA shape, whereas shape-disrupting SNPs are more likely to be eliminated through purifying selection.},

abstract = {Single nucleotide mutation rates have critical implications for human evolution and genetic diseases. Accurate modeling of these mutation rates has long remained an open problem since the rates vary substantially across the human genome. A recent model, however, explained much of the variation by considering higher order nucleotide interactions in the local (7-mer) sequence context around mutated nucleotides. Despite this model’s predictive value, we still lack a biophysically-grounded understanding of genome-wide mutation rate variations. DNA shape features are geometric measurements of DNA structural properties, such as helical twist and tilt, and are known to capture information on interactions between neighboring nucleotides within a local context. Motivated by this characteristic of DNA shape features, we used them to model mutation rates in the human genome. The DNA shape feature based models show up to 15% higher accuracy than the current nucleotide sequence-based models and pinpoint DNA structural properties predictive of mutation rates in the human genome. Further analyzing the mutation rates of individual positions of transcription factor (TF) binding sites in the human genome, we found a strong association between DNA shape and the position-specific mutation rates. The trend holds for hundreds of TFs and is even stronger in evolutionarily conserved regions. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt that demonstrates the structural underpinnings of nucleotide mutations in the human genome and lays the groundwork for future studies to incorporate DNA shape information in modeling genetic variations.},

abstract = {Microbial factories lacking the ability of dynamically regulating the pathway enzymes overexpression, according to in situ metabolite concentrations, are suboptimal, especially when the metabolic intermediates are competed by growth and chemical production. The production of higher alcohols (HAs), which hijacks the amino acids (AAs) from protein biosynthesis, minimizes the intracellular concentration of AAs and thus inhibits the host growth. To balance the resource allocation and maintain stable AA flux, this work utilizes AA‐responsive transcriptional attenuator ivbL and HA‐responsive transcriptional activator BmoR to establish a concentration recognition‐based auto‐dynamic regulation system (CRUISE). This system ultimately maintains the intracellular homeostasis of AA and maximizes the production of HA. It is demonstrated that ivbL‐driven enzymes overexpression can dynamically regulate the AA‐to‐HA conversion while BmoR‐driven enzymes overexpression can accelerate the AA biosynthesis during the HA production in a feedback activation mode. The AA flux in biosynthesis and conversion pathways is balanced via the intracellular AA concentration, which is vice versa stabilized by the competition between AA biosynthesis and conversion. The CRUISE, further aided by scaffold‐based self‐assembly, enables 40.4 g L−1 of isobutanol production in a bioreactor. Taken together, CRUISE realizes robust HA production and sheds new light on the dynamic flux control during the process of chemical production.},

They work together to regulate the degree to which each gene is expressed. The affinity with which DNA is bound by a particular TF can vary more than a thousand-fold with different DNA sequences. This study presents the first computational method able to quantify the sequence-affinity relationship almost perfectly over the full affinity range. It achieves this by analyzing data from experiments that use massively parallel DNA sequencing to comprehensively probe protein–DNA interactions. Strikingly, it can accurately predict the effect in vivo of DNA mutations on gene expression levels in fly embryos even for very-low-affinity binding sites. Transcription factors (TFs) control gene expression by binding to genomic DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Mutations in TF binding sites are increasingly found to be associated with human disease, yet we currently lack robust methods to predict these sites. Here, we developed a versatile maximum likelihood framework named No Read Left Behind (NRLB) that infers a biophysical model of protein-DNA recognition across the full affinity range from a library of in vitro selected DNA binding sites. NRLB predicts human Max homodimer binding in near-perfect agreement with existing low-throughput measurements. It can capture the specificity of the p53 tetramer and distinguish multiple binding modes within a single sample. Additionally, we confirm that newly identified low-affinity enhancer binding sites are functional in vivo, and that their contribution to gene expression matches their predicted affinity. Our results establish a powerful paradigm for identifying protein binding sites and interpreting gene regulatory sequences in eukaryotic genomes.},

We found distinct homeodomain regions that were more correlated with either the nucleotide sequence or the DNA shape of their preferred binding sites, demonstrating different readout mechanisms through which homeodomains attain DNA binding specificity. We identified specific homeodomain residues that likely play key roles in DNA recognition via shape readout.

abstract = {Abstract We are now in an era where protein–DNA interactions have been experimentally assayed for thousands of DNA-binding proteins. In order to infer DNA-binding specificities from these data, numerous sophisticated computational methods have been developed. These approaches typically infer DNA-binding specificities by considering interactions for each protein independently, ignoring related and potentially valuable interaction information across other proteins that bind DNA via the same structural domain. Here we introduce a framework for inferring DNA-binding specificities by considering protein–DNA interactions for entire groups of structurally similar proteins simultaneously. We devise both constrained optimization and label propagation algorithms for this task, each balancing observations at the individual protein level against dataset-wide consistency of interaction preferences. We test our approaches on two large, independent Cys2His2 zinc finger protein–DNA interaction datasets. We demonstrate that jointly inferring specificities within each dataset individually dramatically improves accuracy, leading to increased agreement both between these two datasets and with a fixed external standard. Overall, our results suggest that sharing protein–DNA interaction information across structurally similar proteins is a powerful means to enable accurate inference of DNA-binding specificities.},

abstract = {Abstract Sequence-dependent DNA shape plays an important role in understanding protein–DNA binding mechanisms. High-throughput prediction of DNA shape features has become a valuable tool in the field of protein–DNA recognition, transcription factor–DNA binding specificity, and gene regulation. However, our widely used webserver, DNAshape, relies on statistically summarized pentamer query tables to query DNA shape features. These query tables do not consider flanking regions longer than two base pairs, and acquiring a query table for hexamers or higher-order k-mers is currently still unrealistic due to limitations in achieving sufficient statistical coverage in molecular simulations or structural biology experiments. A recent deep-learning method, Deep DNAshape, can predict DNA shape features at the core of a DNA fragment considering flanking regions of up to seven base pairs, trained on limited simulation data. However, Deep DNAshape is rather complicated to install, and it must run locally compared to the pentamer-based DNAshape webserver, creating a barrier for users. Here, we present the Deep DNAshape webserver, which has the benefits of both methods while being accurate, fast, and accessible to all users. Additional improvements of the webserver include the detection of user input in real time, the ability of interactive visualization tools and different modes of analyses.

abstract = {Abstract Recognition of DNA by proteins depends on DNA sequence and structure. Often unanswered is whether the structure of naked DNA persists in a protein–DNA complex, or whether protein binding changes DNA shape. While X-ray structures of protein–DNA complexes are numerous, the structure of naked cognate DNA is seldom available experimentally. We present here an experimental and computational analysis pipeline that uses hydroxyl radical cleavage to map, at single-nucleotide resolution, DNA minor groove width, a recognition feature widely exploited by proteins. For 11 protein–DNA complexes, we compared experimental maps of naked DNA minor groove width with minor groove width measured from X-ray co-crystal structures. Seven sites had similar minor groove widths as naked DNA and when bound to protein. For four sites, part of the DNA in the complex had the same structure as naked DNA, and part changed structure upon protein binding. We compared the experimental map with minor groove patterns of DNA predicted by two computational approaches, DNAshape and ORChID2, and found good but not perfect concordance with both. This experimental approach will be useful in mapping structures of DNA sequences for which high-resolution structural data are unavailable. This approach allows probing of protein family-dependent readout mechanisms.},

abstract = {The recognition potential of most families of DNA-binding domains (DBDs) remains relatively unexplored. Homeodomains (HDs), like many other families of DBDs, display limited diversity in their preferred recognition sequences. To explore the recognition potential of HDs, we utilized a bacterial selection system to isolate HD variants, from a randomized library, that are compatible with each of the 64 possible 3′ triplet sites (i.e., TAANNN). The majority of these selections yielded sets of HDs with overrepresented residues at specific recognition positions, implying the selection of specific binders. The DNA-binding specificity of 151 representative HD variants was subsequently characterized, identifying HDs that preferentially recognize 44 of these target sites. Many of these variants contain novel combinations of specificity determinants that are uncommon or absent in extant HDs. These novel determinants, when grafted into different HD backbones, produce a corresponding alteration in specificity. This information was used to create more explicit HD recognition models, which can inform the prediction of transcriptional regulatory networks for extant HDs or the engineering of HDs with novel DNA-recognition potential. The diversity of recovered HD recognition sequences raises important questions about the fitness barrier that restricts the evolution of alternate recognition modalities in natural systems.},

abstract = {The recognition and binding of nucleic acids (NAs) by proteins depends upon complementary chemical, electrostatic and geometric properties of the protein-NA binding interface. Structural models of protein-NA complexes provide insights into these properties but are scarce relative to models of unbound proteins. We present a deep learning approach for predicting protein-NA binding given the apo structure of a protein (PNAbind). Our method utilizes graph neural networks to encode spatial distributions of physicochemical and geometric properties of the protein molecular surface that are predictive of NA binding. Using global physicochemical encodings, our models predict the overall binding function of a protein and can discriminate between specificity for DNA or RNA binding. We show that such predictions made on protein structures modeled with AlphaFold2 can be used to gain mechanistic understanding of chemical and structural features that determine NA recognition. Using local encodings, our models predict the location of NA binding sites at the level of individual binding residues. Binding site predictions were validated against benchmark datasets, achieving AUROC scores in the range of 0.92-0.95. We applied our models to the HIV-1 restriction factor APOBEC3G and show that our predictions are consistent with experimental RNA binding data.},

abstract = {Understanding gene regulation is a key challenge in today's biology. The new technologies of protein-binding microarrays (PBMs) and high-throughput SELEX (HT-SELEX) allow measurement of the binding intensities of one transcription factor (TF) to numerous synthetic double-stranded DNA sequences in a single experiment. Recently, Jolma et al. reported the results of 547 HT-SELEX experiments covering human and mouse TFs. Because 162 of these TFs were also covered by PBM technology, for the first time, a large-scale comparison between implementations of these two in vitro technologies is possible. Here we assessed the similarities and differences between binding models, represented as position weight matrices, inferred from PBM and HT-SELEX, and also measured how well these models predict in vivo binding. Our results show that HT-SELEX- and PBM-derived models agree for most TFs. For some TFs, the HT-SELEX-derived models are longer versions of the PBM-derived models, whereas for other TFs, the HT-SELEX models match the secondary PBM-derived models. Remarkably, PBM-based 8-mer ranking is more accurate than that of HT-SELEX, but models derived from HT-SELEX predict in vivo binding better. In addition, we reveal several biases in HT-SELEX data including nucleotide frequency bias, enrichment of C-rich k-mers and oligos and underrepresentation of palindromes.},
