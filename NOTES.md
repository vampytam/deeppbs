## PWM 
position weight matrices, PWMs用来表示蛋白质-DNA结合特异性

protein binding affinity to DNA/RNA depends on the sequence
通常会允许DNA/RNA序列中某些位置碱基不匹配

## PSSM
position specific scoring matrix, PSSM用来表示蛋白质-DNA结合特异性

PSSM is a normalized version of PWM

## PSSM vs PWM
- PSSM is a normalized version of PWM
- PSSM is a log-odds matrix, which is a measure of the probability of a particular base at a particular position in a sequence
- PWM is a matrix of probabilities of a particular base at a particular position in a sequence
- PSSM is used to calculate the binding affinity of a protein to a DNA/RNA sequence
- PWM is used to calculate the probability of a particular base at a particular position in a sequence
